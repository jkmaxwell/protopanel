# Protopanel

Control panel for setting states in interactive prototypes, specifically designed for sketch-framer

### Getting Started

#### Link up the index

In your prototype's index, pull in (in order)

1. the CSS
2. the js
3. the JSON

#### Edit the JSON

Edit the JSON to reflect your desired states and classes

#### Use the classes in your JSON within your prototype

Each section in the JSON has a prefix and suffixes that correspond to states. For example, in the demo JSON, the first section is "state". This adds a prefix of "state-".

Selecting one of the states then sets the body class state-statename, such as "state-new" or "state-existing". These are up to you.

### What Next?

The code is absolute garbage and was just written to get the job done.
